## Testing

### Overview

**⚠️ Testing Environment**: For best results, run tests on **Debian/Ubuntu** systems where devbox is fully functional. CI runs on Linux only; other platforms are not supported.

devbox has a comprehensive test suite that includes:
- **Unit tests** for individual functions and components
- **Integration tests** for CLI commands and end-to-end functionality (Debian/Ubuntu only)
- **Security tests** and vulnerability scanning
- **Performance tests** with race condition detection

### Test Structure

```
test/
├── integration/           # End-to-end CLI tests
│   └── cli_test.go
internal/
├── commands/
│   ├── version_test.go    # Version command tests
│   └── root_test.go       # Project validation tests
├── config/
│   ├── config_test.go     # Config struct tests
│   └── config_manager_test.go  # File operations tests
├── docker/
│   └── client_test.go     # Docker client tests
└── testutil/
    ├── testutil.go        # Test helpers and utilities
    └── testutil_test.go   # Tests for test utilities
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run tests with race detection (Linux)
go test -race ./...

# Run specific test packages
go test ./internal/commands -v
go test ./internal/config -v
go test ./test/integration -v

# Generate coverage report
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

### Writing Tests

#### Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Include both success and failure cases
- Use table-driven tests when appropriate
- Mock external dependencies (Docker, filesystem)
- Aim for meaningful test coverage (not just percentage)

#### Integration Tests
- Test CLI commands end-to-end
- Verify error messages and exit codes
- Handle OS-specific behavior gracefully
- Test argument validation and help text

#### Test Utilities
Use the `internal/testutil` package for common operations:

```go
import "devbox/internal/testutil"

func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    // Create test data
    config := testutil.CreateTestConfig()
    project := testutil.CreateTestProject("my-project")

    // Use test assertions
    testutil.AssertNoError(t, err)
    testutil.AssertEqual(t, expected, actual)
    testutil.AssertNotNil(t, result)
}
```

### Test Guidelines

- **Fast**: Unit tests should run quickly (< 100ms each)
- **Isolated**: Tests shouldn't depend on external services
- **Deterministic**: Tests should produce consistent results
- **Clear**: Test names should describe what they verify
- **Comprehensive**: Cover happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions

### Test Structure

```go
func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid input",
            input:    "test-project",
            expected: "test-project",
            wantErr:  false,
        },
        {
            name:    "invalid input",
            input:   "invalid@project",
            wantErr: true,
        },
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result, err := FunctionName(tt.input)

            if tt.wantErr {
                testutil.AssertError(t, err, "")
                return
            }

            testutil.AssertNoError(t, err)
            testutil.AssertEqual(t, tt.expected, result)
        })
    }
}
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflows

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and quality assurance:

#### 1. Main CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
Runs on every push and pull request:
- **Multi-version testing** (Go 1.21, 1.22)
- **Comprehensive test suite** with race detection
- **Linux builds only** (Ubuntu/Debian)
- **Code linting** with golangci-lint
- **Security scanning** with gosec and govulncheck
- **Coverage reporting** with Codecov integration

#### 2. Linux Tests (`.github/workflows/cross-platform-tests.yml`)
Ensures stability on supported Linux runners:
- **Ubuntu** testing
- **Daily scheduled runs** for regression detection
- **Binary execution verification**

#### 3. Coverage Reporting (`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`)
Detailed test coverage analysis:
- **Atomic coverage mode** for accuracy
- **HTML and text reports** generation
- **Coverage trend tracking**
- **PR coverage comments**

#### 4. Test Status Summary (`.github/workflows/test-status.yml`)
Rich reporting in GitHub Actions:
- **Test result summaries**
- **Coverage percentage display**
- **Markdown-formatted reports**

### Quality Gates

All pull requests must pass:
- ✅ **All tests** (unit + integration)
- ✅ **Linting checks** (golangci-lint)
- ✅ **Security scans** (gosec, govulncheck)
- ✅ **Linux builds**
- ✅ **Code coverage** maintained or improved

### Local CI Simulation

Run the same checks locally before pushing:

```bash
# Full quality check suite
make quality

# Individual checks
make test          # Run all tests
make test-coverage # Generate coverage
make lint          # Code linting
make security      # Security scanning
make fmt           # Code formatting
```

### Automated Checks

The CI system automatically:
- **Runs tests** on multiple Go versions
- **Builds binaries** for all target platforms
- **Scans for vulnerabilities** in dependencies
- **Checks code formatting** and style
- **Validates documentation** changes
- **Generates coverage reports**
- **Creates build artifacts**

### Working with CI

#### When CI Fails:
1. **Check the logs** in GitHub Actions tab
2. **Run tests locally** to reproduce the issue
3. **Fix the issue** and push again
4. **Don't ignore CI failures** - they indicate real problems

#### Tips for Success:
- **Run tests locally** before pushing
- **Keep commits atomic** and focused
- **Write descriptive commit messages**
- **Update tests** when changing functionality
- **Check coverage** to ensure new code is tested

### Debugging CI Failures

Common CI issues and solutions:

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Reproduce locally
go test -v ./internal/package_name

# Check for race conditions (Linux)
go test -race ./...

# Run integration tests
go test -v ./test/integration
```

#### Linting Failures
```bash
# Run linter locally
make lint

# Auto-fix formatting issues
make fmt

# Check specific files
golangci-lint run ./internal/commands/
```

#### Coverage Issues
```bash
# Generate local coverage report
make test-coverage

# View coverage by function
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Open HTML coverage report
open coverage.html
```

#### Platform-Specific Issues

**⚠️ Important Note**: devbox is designed to work only on **Debian/Ubuntu** systems. CI runs on Linux only; other platforms are not supported.

**Recommended Testing Environment**:
- **Debian 11+** or **Ubuntu 20.04+** for best results
- **Docker containers** running Debian/Ubuntu for isolated testing
- **WSL2 with Ubuntu** on Windows for development

**Platform-Specific Behavior**:
