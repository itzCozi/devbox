title: Quick Start Guide
description: Get up and running with devbox in minutes
---

This guide will get you up and running with devbox in just a few minutes. You'll create your first isolated development environment and learn the basic workflow.

## Prerequisites
---

Before starting, make sure you have devbox installed. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the [Installation Guide](/docs//install/) first.

## Create Your First Project
---

Let's create a Python development environment:

```bash
devbox init my-python-app --template python
```

This command:
- Creates a new project called `my-python-app`
- Uses the Python template (includes Python 3, pip, and common tools)
- Sets up a Docker box (container) with Ubuntu 22.04
- Creates a workspace directory at `~/devbox/my-python-app/`

## Enter Your Development Environment
---

```bash
devbox shell my-python-app
```

You're now inside an isolated Ubuntu box! Notice how your prompt changes to indicate you're in the devbox environment.
By default, the box will stop automatically when you exit the shell. To keep it running after you exit, pass `--keep-running`.

## Explore the Environment
---

Inside the box, you can:

```bash
# Check what's available
python3 --version
pip3 --version
which python3

# Your workspace is mounted at /workspace
cd /workspace
ls -la

# Install additional packages
apt update
apt install tree htop

# Install Python packages
pip3 install requests flask

# These installs are automatically recorded to /workspace/devbox.lock
# so the environment can be reproduced on rebuild or by teammates.
```

## Create and Run Code
---

Create a simple Python application:

```bash
# Create a simple web app
cat > /workspace/app.py << 'EOF'
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello from devbox! ðŸš€'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
EOF

# Run your app
python3 app.py
```

## Manage Your Projects
---

```bash
# List all your projects
devbox list

# Create more projects
devbox init node-app --template nodejs
devbox init go-service --template go

# Each project is completely isolated
devbox shell node-app    # Node.js environment
devbox shell go-service  # Go environment
```

## Clean Up
---

When you're done with a project:

```bash
# Stop and remove the box (keeps your files)
devbox destroy my-python-app

# Or just stop the box without removing it
devbox stop my-python-app

# Your files are still in ~/devbox/my-python-app/
ls ~/devbox/my-python-app/

# To recreate the environment later:
devbox init my-python-app --template python
```

## Docker Access
---

By default, all devbox environments have access to the host's Docker daemon, allowing you to:

- Build and manage Docker boxes/containers from within your devbox environment
- Run Docker commands without additional configuration
- Execute Docker Compose for multi-box (multi-container) applications

This works by mounting the host's Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) in your devbox box (container) and installing the Docker CLI tools automatically.

## Next Steps
---

Now that you understand the basics:

1. **Explore the commands**: [Command Reference](/docs/cli/)
2. **Learn about configuration**: [Configuration Guide](/docs/configuration/)
3. **Explore templates**: Try different [project templates](/docs/templates/)
4. **Customize**: Create a custom `devbox.json` config file
5. **Maintenance**: [Cleanup and Maintenance](/docs/cleanup-maintenance/)
